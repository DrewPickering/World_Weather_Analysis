Project Overview:
  Provide real-time suggestions for PlanMyTrip client’s ideal hotel based on 1. A given range of latitude and longitude and 2. The right    kind of weather.
  Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide to be used for providing PlanMyTrip clients recommendations based on their      weather preferences.
	Determine the correlations for the following weather data:
    Latitude and temperature
    Latitude and humidity
    Latitude and cloudiness
    Latitude and wind speed

  Create a series of heatmaps using the Google Maps and Places API with pop-up markers that can display information on specific cities      based on a customer’s travel preferences. Complete these steps:

  Filter the Pandas DataFrame based on user inputs for a minimum and maximum temperature.
  Create a heatmap for the new DataFrame.
  Find a hotel from the cities’ coordinates using Google’s Maps and Places API, and Search Nearby feature.
  Store the name of the first hotel in the DataFrame.
  Add pop-up markers to the heatmap that display information about the city, current maximum temperature, and a hotel in the city.
